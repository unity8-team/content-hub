  [ Ken VanDine ]
  * Adds a store property to the Transfer, which defaults to an
    cuc::Scope::app scope and appended with "HubIncoming/${id}". The hub
    will copy the files to that store when the transfer gets charged and
    set the proper paths based on the Store::url when setting
    Transfer::items. To handle cleaning up temporary copies of files,
    this adds an additional state to the tranfer "finalized" and a
    finalize function to the API. When the importer calls finalize, the
    hub will purge the copied files, but only if the destination didn't
    specify their own persistent content store. On purge, we only remove
    the files if the store is set to the default used by the hub. If the
    destination set a different store, we leave the files there. This is
    an important implementation detail, without setting a persistent
    store, a QML app wouldn't have a way to copy the files out of the
    incoming directory into their own persistent location. Allowing the
    destination app to setStore, gives it a way to keep the files in
    it's own store for future access. If the destination doesn't set the
    store, we assume the destination app is done with the content before
    calling finalize.
  * fixed typo in Type enum.
  * Added a name property to Peer using GAppInfo to get a friendly name.

  * fix for the MockHandler so it doesn't trigger dbus activation .
  * explicitly build dep on libglib2.0-dev .
  * Updated handler names and paths to use nih_dbus_path to sanitize the
    names. nih_dbus_path is designed to really just return a dbus path,
    however this is the same function apparmor uses to mangle app_id
    names for policy, so it should ensure we can match consistently.
    This is needed for confined apps.
  * Use QGSettings for persistent peer registration and set defaults.
    Also adds a helper install peers, which will be used as a click
    hook, but doesn't get installed yet.

  [ Ken VanDine ]
  * Adds a Handler interface and adapter which provides get registered
    on the bus from the Hub client. The service side will look for
    registered handlers when a new transfer is created. The service then
    connects to transfer and calls HandleExport on the handler when the
    transfer state changes to in_progress. There is still no hooks in
    the service to call HandleImport for registered import handlers, but
    clients can connect to stateChanged and fire their own import when
    the state changes to charged. Handler registration requires APP_ID
    be set in the client's env, which we can drop when we get app
    manager integration. It also requires the export handler to be
    registered before the client creates the transfer.
